This is my Milestone Project for User Centric Frontend Development
## Vladimirs Boreckis Personal Profile Website
This is a personal profile website of a professional coder/designer aimed at advertising his skill, personality and work ethics.
The visitors are encouraged to entrust the development of their website throughout the pages with quotes, skill set and previous work examples. 
It has a clean and stylish look that should draw the users attention to what the developer is capable of. 
The minimalistic text and look does not frustrate the user with information overload, yet is interesting enough for them to go on ahead and contact the designer for a more detailed discussion about the project they want them to be involved in. 
The website and it’s host sends an open, positive, “can do” message to the user.
