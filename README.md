# portfolio-milestone-1
This is my Milestone Project for User Centric Frontend Development
## Vladimirs Boreckis Personal Profile Website
This is a personal profile website of a professional coder/designer aimed at advertising his skill, personality and work ethics.
The visitors are encouraged to entrust the development of their website throughout the pages with quotes, skill set and previous work examples. 
It has a clean and stylish look that should draw the users attention to what the developer is capable of. 
The minimalistic text and look does not frustrate the user with information overload, yet is interesting enough for them to go on ahead and contact the designer for a more detailed discussion about the project they want them to be involved in. 
The website and it’s host sends an open, positive, “can do” message to the user.

# UX

The user will typically be a small to medium business owner that has decided to have a website developed for their company.
Another user group can potentially be company that is head hunting for talent in software development as a part of a larger organization.
As well as companies, certain individuals might look for a coder for their projects on partnership basis. 
User Stories examples:

•	As a small company owner, I want to find a developer that can provide me with the best possible personal service catering to my business needs so that I can continue to grow my business.

•	As an HR manager of a large organization, there is a particular individual with particular kind of skill criteria we are looking for to start/finish/collaborate on a large scale development project.

•	As an individual who has the best idea in the world, but is unable to execute on it due to lack of development skills I will consider making an offer of partnership to the coder.

•	As a user I want to find out how to contact the person presented in the profile via email, skype, social links and telephone.

•	As a user I want to get an idea if the developers personality, skills and professional standards are the ones I look for in a developer.

•	As a potential customer I want to see previous work done by the developer to understand the quality.

•	As a headhunter I need to be able to see a full CV of the developer.

•	As the developer I want my users to be able to reach me.

•	As the developer I want to encourage visitors to take action.

To accommodate what the UX should be certain requirements have been set. These are: 

1.	The profile needs showcase the developer in a professional manner.

2.	Potential clients need to have enough understanding about the developer to inform their decision to contact them.

3.	Users need to see a variety of example in developers portfolio.

4.	Interested users have to have the ability to contact the developer for further enquiries. 

5.	Interested users need to have the option to download profile holders full CV.

6.	There have to be links to social media and a Contacts page to further enquire about the developer.

7.	The user needs to have an understanding of developers skill set.


# UI structure

After understanding the requirements and taking into consideration best design practices the structure of the website was clear.

•	Home Page – divided into two large sections; containing a large picture of the developer and a brief pitch with the ability to download the CV straight away. Stylized logo of the developer in the navigation bar and a quote in the footer.

•	About Page – divided into two large sections; showing off skills and work ethics of the developer visually, as well as text.

•	Portfolio Page – showing of past projects to give a scope of the profile holders abilities.

•	Contact Page – hosting a number of means to contact the developer.

•	Navigation and social links are fixed.

A ruff model was created for this profile website in MS Paint and is available as a .jpg file in the repository. Minor adjustments and changes are present in the final version of the website.
